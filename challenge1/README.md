# Numbers Fractions Calculator

You will receive an array of numbers, and your challenge is to calculate the fractions of each type of number (positive, negative, and zeros).

### Input and Output

You will receive an input like the one below:

```
[-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]
```

And with this, you should calculate the fractions of each type internally, as mentioned above.

Your function should return an object like the example below:

```
{
    positives: 0.500000,
    negatives: 0.333333,
    zeros: 0.166667,
}
```

Notice: Remember to be careful with the number precision.

_Obs: What is a fraction? Fractions represent the parts of a whole or collection of objects. A fraction has two parts. The number on the top of the line is called the numerator. It tells how many equal parts of the whole or collection are taken. In the mentioned example above, positives are 0.5/1 because there are 3 positive numbers on the example, negatives are 0.333333/1 because there are 2 negatives on the example, and zeros are 0.166667 because there is only one zero; if you sum everything, the result will be 1_
